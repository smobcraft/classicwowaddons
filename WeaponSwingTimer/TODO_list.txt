BUGS
* Hunter bar takes roughly 3 seconds to load when the interface is reloaded
* Speed buffs should only affect the next swing

TODO FROM STRESS TEST
* Dragging and dropping to any point other than CENTER causes the offsets in the settings to be off
	I need to make a utility that converts other points to CENTER
* Need to fixup the config menu
* Hunter bar needs some latency marker for the 0.5 "cast time" of autoshot
* Make YaHT multishot bar two markers like it is with the onebar setting
* Make the Multishot marker not on by default (Popup window when hunter turns 18 to enable it if they want to)
* Landing page of the addon acts like a tutorial
* The hunter auto shot cast time seems to be inconsistant. 
	There is a a 0.15s swing between the full autoshot cooldown and cast, and a 0.7 swing between the cast time. 
	The cast time was between 0.53s and 0.63s with a 2.3s bow with a rnage speed of 2.091
	The whole shot time was between 2.051 and 2.187 while standing still with a range speed of 2.091
* Hunter cast time seems to be increased if the cast time has been cliped significantly 
	(like a full 0.5s clip causes the shot cast time to be roughly 1.0-0.9 secs)

THINGS ACE3 WOULD MAKE EASIER
* Profiles would also be nice
* Add something so the addon adds a button that attaches to the minimap
* Multiple textures would also be nice
* Changable font size would be nice
* Changable fonts would also be nice
